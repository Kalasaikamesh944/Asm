## Introduction
CPU Registers and System Calls are fundamental components in computer architecture that play an essential role in the operation of a computer system. 
CPU Registers store data temporarily for quick processing, while system calls allow programs to request services from the operating system.

This document explains the concept of CPU Registers and System Calls.

## CPU Registers
### Definition
CPU Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU used for storing data, instructions, or addresses that are frequently accessed.

### Types of CPU Registers:
1. **General Purpose Registers**: Used for temporary data storage during program execution.
   - Example: AX, BX, CX in x86 architecture.
2. **Special Purpose Registers**: Used for specific tasks such as stack management.
   - Example: Stack Pointer (SP), Base Pointer (BP).
3. **Status Registers**: Stores flags that indicate the status of operations.
   - Example: Flags Register in x86.
4. **Control Registers**: Used to control the operation of the CPU.
   - Example: CR0, CR2 in x86.
5. **Program Counter**: Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
6. **Accumulator Register**: Used to store intermediate results during arithmetic operations.

## System Calls
### Definition
System Calls are the mechanism through which a program requests services from the operating system.

### Types of System Calls:
1. **Process Control**: Includes system calls for managing processes, such as creating, terminating, or suspending processes.
2. **File Management**: System calls for file operations like opening, closing, reading, and writing files.
3. **Device Management**: System calls for managing hardware devices, including input/output operations.
4. **Information Maintenance**: Includes system calls for handling system information, such as getting system time.
5. **Communication**: System calls for inter-process communication, such as message passing or pipe management.

### How System Calls Work
A system call is invoked by a program to request a service from the operating system. The program typically uses a software interrupt to transfer control to the OS kernel.

### Examples of System Calls
- `fork()`, `exec()`, `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`

## Conclusion
CPU Registers and System Calls are crucial for system performance and program execution. Understanding these components helps in grasping how the CPU interacts with the operating system and processes tasks efficiently.
